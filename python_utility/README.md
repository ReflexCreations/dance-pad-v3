# RE:Flex Dance v3 Python Utility

Hello, this is a mostly empty project at the moment. I recently started working as a professional software developer, so this is mostly a self-masturbatory experiment into software design patterns, so if you wonder 'what the hell are you doing?' the answer is that I'm trying to learn things.

At the same time, I may as well put that to good use. So this project is effectively a self-guided learning experience for me to improve my development skills, while also adding functionality I've always wanted to RE:Flex and de-janking the previous python-interface of v2.

That being said, if you happen to be a software developer, and feel like going through my work, please do, and critique is more than welcomed.
